Project Name: LexiBlocks

Game Concept Overview:
LexiBlocks is a fast-paced, Tetris-inspired word game where falling blocks are alphabet letters. Players must strategically position letters to form valid words horizontally or vertically. As in Tetris, gameplay speeds up over time. Points are awarded for forming words, and smart logic guides the letter drops to promote solvable words.

2. Target Audience

    Casual gamers
    Word puzzle enthusiasts
    Students (with grading levels for vocabulary)

3. Core Features

    Letter blocks fall from the top
    Player rotates/moves blocks to position
    Valid words can form horizontally or vertically
    Points are awarded for each valid word
    Difficulty increases with levels (faster drops)
    Word database is categorized by vocabulary grade level (Grade 1 to advanced)
    Smart drop engine biases letter selections to ensure formable words are possible
    Line clears when words are formed; score and space are updated
    Player receives points for single and compound word formations (e.g., KIN and SKIN)

4. Gameplay Mechanics

    Grid Size: 10x20 (standard)
    Letters drop in 1x1 blocks

    Grade Level Multiplier: (Grade level of the word)
    Combo Bonus: +50 for each additional word formed in the same move
    Level Bonus: Multiplied by current level

6. Vocabulary Engine

    Word list categorized by grade level (importable from common curriculum lists)
    Smart engine predicts valid continuations based on current placed letters
    Probability-biased letter generation (not fully random)
    AI logic to balance challenge and solvability

7. Level System

    Every 1000 points = next level
    Increased speed and slightly more complex letters/words

8. Modes

    Endless Mode
    Timed Mode (2/5/10 min)
    Challenge Mode (specific tasks, e.g., form 10 Grade 3 words)

9. UI/UX Requirements
